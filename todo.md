how is 1 different from 2
1 = 'Every time you update a todo you shouldn't have to re-get the entire list you already know what changed about the one todo'
2 = 'If you think through some of the actions being performed you might find a way to optimize the list by only updating the one todo that changes at a time'

curious about how else to toggle between F/C/K
